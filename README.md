# Traveling_Salesman


Suppose there are a number of "cities," as in Figure 1 below. The distance between any two
cities is the standard Euclidean distance, that is, âˆš((x1-x2)2+(y1-y2)2). A traveling salesman
wishes to visit every city exactly once, then return to his starting point. (It doesn't matter what
city is the starting point.) Such a path is called a circuit, as in Figure 2. However, the salesman
also wishes to minimize the total distance that must be traveled.
